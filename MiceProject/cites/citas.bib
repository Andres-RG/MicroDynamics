Data treatment effected the estimation of community richness over a 6-year period, whereby 8794 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified using single-linkage preclustering and 21 130 OTUs were identified by denoising the 
data. The Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant Class, and the most frequently recorded OTUs were members of the Rickettsiales (SAR 11) and Rhodobacteriales. This near-surface ocean bacterial community showed strong 
repeatable seasonal patterns, which were defined by winter peaks in diversity across all years. Environmental variables explained far more variation in seasonally predictable bacteria than did data on protists or metazoan biomass. 
Change in day length alone explains \&gt;65\% of the variance in community diversity. The results suggested that seasonal changes in environmental variables are more important than trophic interactions. Interestingly, microbial 
association network analysis showed that correlations in abundance were stronger within bacterial taxa rather than between bacteria and eukaryotes, or between bacteria and environmental variables.}",

abstract={Although regime shifts are known from various ecosystems, the involvement of microbial communities is poorly understood. Here we show that gradual environmental changes induced by, for example, eutrophication or global 
warming can induce major oxic-anoxic regime shifts. We first investigate a mathematical model describing interactions between microbial communities and biogeochemical oxidation-reduction reactions. In response to gradual changes 
in oxygen influx, this model abruptly transitions between an oxic state dominated by cyanobacteria and an anoxic state with sulfate-reducing bacteria and phototrophic sulfur bacteria. The model predictions are consistent with 
observations from a seasonally stratified lake, which shows hysteresis in the transition between oxic and anoxic states with similar changes in microbial community composition. Our results suggest that hysteresis loops and tipping 
points are a common feature of oxic-anoxic transitions, causing rapid drops in oxygen levels that are not easily reversed, at scales ranging from small ponds to global oceanic anoxic events.},

abstract = {Nowadays, microbial communities are frequently monitored over long periods of time and the interactions between their members are explored in vitro. This development has opened the way to apply mathematical models to 
characterize community structure and dynamics, to predict responses to perturbations and to explore general dynamical properties such as stability, alternative stable states and periodicity. Here, we highlight the role of 
dynamical systems theory in the exploration of microbial communities, with a special emphasis on the generalized Lotka–Volterra (gLV) equations. In particular, we discuss applications, assumptions and limitations of the gLV model, 
mention modifications to address these limitations and review stochastic extensions. The development of dynamical models, together with the generation of time series data, can improve the design and control of microbial 
communities.}

abstract={Early Warning Signals (EWS) have generated much excitement for their potential to anticipate transitions in various systems, ranging from climate change in ecology to disease staging in medicine. EWS hold particular promise for bifurcations, a transition 
mechanism in which a smooth, gradual change in a control parameter of the system results in a rapid change in system dynamics. The predominant reason to expect EWS is because many bifurcations are preceded by Critical Slowing Down (CSD): if assuming the system is 
subject to continuous, small, Gaussian noise, the system is slower to recover from perturbations closer to the transition. However, this focus on warning signs generated by stochasticity has overshadowed warning signs which may already be found in deterministic 
dynamics. This is especially true for higher-dimensional systems, where more complex attractors with intrinsic dynamics such as oscillations not only become possible---they are increasingly more likely. The present study focuses on univariate and multivariate EWS 
in deterministic dynamics to anticipate complex critical transitions, including the period-doubling cascade to chaos, chaos-chaos transitions, and the extinction of a chaotic attractor. In a four-dimensional continuous-time Lotka--Volterra model, EWS perform well 
for most bifurcations, even with lower data quality. The present study highlights three reasons why EWS may still work in the absence of CSD: changing attractor morphology (size, shape, and location in phase space), shifting power spectra (amplitude and 
frequency), and chaotic transitional characteristics (density across attractor). More complex attractors call for different warning detection methods to utilise warning signs already contained within purely deterministic dynamics.},

   abstract = "Ecological resilience is the ability of a system to persist in the face of perturbations. Although resilience has been a highly influential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative. Here we describe an emerging family of methods 
for quantifying resilience on the basis of observations. A first set of methods is based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which implies that recovery upon small perturbations becomes slower as a system approaches a tipping point. Such slowing down can 
be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natural fluctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of 
observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the system-specific knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems.",

abstract = {Little is known on whether structurally diverse ecological networks may respond abruptly to anthropogenic stress and even less on our ability to detect such responses in advance. By simulating mutualistic communities en route to a tipping point, we 
show how critical slowing-down indicators may be used as early warnings for the collapse of ecological networks. Our findings not only confirm the existence of the generic dynamical signatures of tipping points in ecological networks but also suggest a promising 
way for identifying most vulnerable components in a broad class of networks at the brink of collapse. Tipping points are crossed when small changes in external conditions cause abrupt unexpected responses in the current state of a system. In the case of ecological 
communities under stress, the risk of approaching a tipping point is unknown, but its stakes are high. Here, we test recently developed critical slowing-down indicators as early-warning signals for detecting the proximity to a potential tipping point in 
structurally complex ecological communities. We use the structure of 79 empirical mutualistic networks to simulate a scenario of gradual environmental change that leads to an abrupt first extinction event followed by a sequence of species losses until the point of 
complete community collapse. We find that critical slowing-down indicators derived from time series of biomasses measured at the species and community level signal the proximity to the onset of community collapse. In particular, we identify specialist species as 
likely the best-indicator species for monitoring the proximity of a community to collapse. In addition, trends in slowing-down indicators are strongly correlated to the timing of species extinctions. This correlation offers a promising way for mapping species 
resilience and ranking species risk to extinction in a given community. Our findings pave the road for combining theory on tipping points with patterns of network structure that might prove useful for the management of a broad class of ecological networks under 
global environmental change.}}
